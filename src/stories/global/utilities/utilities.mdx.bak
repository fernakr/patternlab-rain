Styling should be utility first and then if needed, component specific styling can be added.

To see what utility classes are available or add/update to the utility classes, go to `assets/scss/utilities/_settings.scss` - you can see all of options or enable responsive utilities.

If responsive utilities are enabled, you can use the following classes:

.[class]-[breakpoint]-[value] where breakpoint are the Foundation breakpoints (medium, large, xlarge, xxlarge - small is excluded since that would just be the default .[class]-[value]) and value is the value you want to apply e.g. .text-center would be what's used on small and above screens, .text-large-left would be used on large and above screens, etc.
